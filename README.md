# Vocab-v2
A Vocab Study Dump I made in 7th grade - but i try to make it better for 8th grade

## New features

* WAYYYYY better UI
* Uses `lessons.json` to get all the info:
    * The lesson number
    * Quizlet, Knowt, Gimkit, and Blooket link
    * Alternative button for roots [not yet implemented, will be implemented soon, probably not now that I think about it]
